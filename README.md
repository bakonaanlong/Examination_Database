 # Examination_Database
A database to store and retrieve examination answer sheets efficiently

Project Overview
The Examination Database is designed to provide universities with a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for storing, managing, and retrieving scanned copies of students' written examination answer sheets. This system addresses the need for reliable storage and quick access to answer sheets for purposes such as academic integrity investigations, misconduct cases, or legal proceedings.

Purpose
The purpose of this system is to:

-Digitally store scanned examination answer sheets in a secure and organized manner.
-Enable efficient retrieval of answer sheets for administrative, academic, or legal purposes.
-Ensure data integrity, security, and compliance with privacy regulations.
-Reduce physical storage costs and risks associated with paper-based records.

Scope
The Exams database will include:

-A database to store scanned answer sheets and associated metadata.
-A user-friendly interface for uploading, searching, and retrieving answer sheets.
-Role-based access control to ensure authorized access.
-Compliance with data protection regulations.
-Scalability to handle large volumes of data across multiple institutions.

System Requirements

Functional Requirements
Data Storage

Upload Scanned Answer Sheets: Users (administrators or authorized faculty) can upload scanned answer sheets in common formats (e.g., PDF, JPEG).
Metadata Tagging: Each answer sheet must be tagged with metadata, including:
Student ID
Student Name
Course Code
Exam Date
Semester and Session
Optional: Additional notes or tags (e.g., exam type, misconduct flags)


File Organization: Answer sheets must be organized by Department, course, and session for efficient retrieval.

Data Validation: Ensure uploaded files are valid and metadata is complete before storage.


Data Retrieval

Search Functionality: Users can search for answer sheets using filters such as:
Student ID or Name
Course Code
Exam Date Range
Semester/Session

Preview and Download: Authorized users can preview a low-resolution version of the answer sheet and download the full-resolution file.


User Management

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Admin: Full access to manage users, upload, retrieve, and delete answer sheets.
Faculty: Access to upload and retrieve answer sheets for their courses.
Auditor/Investigator: Read-only access to specific answer sheets for misconduct or legal cases.


Authentication: Secure login using institutional credentials
Authorization: Ensure users only access data relevant to their role and department.

Data Security and Compliance

Encryption: Store all answer sheets and metadata encrypted at rest and in transit
Compliance: Adhere to data protection regulations.
Backup and Recovery: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery to prevent data loss.

Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:
Support storage and retrieval for up to 1 million answer sheets
Search queries must return results within 5 seconds.
Uploads must complete within 10 seconds for files up to 10 MB.

Scalability:
Handle multiple institutions with independent databases or schemas.

Usability:
Intuitive web-based interface accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
Support for bulk uploads (e.g., ZIP files containing multiple answer sheets).

Compatibility:
Support common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Security:
Regular security audits and penetration testing.
Protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).


Technical Requirements

Database: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for metadata and blob storage for scanned files (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Backend: RESTful API built with Node.js framework 
Frontend: Web interface using React.js with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Deployment: Cloud-based (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP) with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for scalability.
File Formats: Support PDF and JPEG


Assumptions:
Institutions have access to scanning hardware for digitizing answer sheets.
Users have basic technical proficiency for operating the system.

Constraints:
System must comply with regional data protection laws.

Deliverables

Database system with storage and retrieval capabilities.
Web-based user interface for upload, search, and access.
API documentation for integration with institutional systems.
User manuals for administrators, faculty, and auditors.
Compliance and security audit reports.
